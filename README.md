# Machine Learning in R course

We were given a data set of condos/apartments from the Queens, NYC area, with a lot of missing data.  The challenge of the project was to handle the missing data in the most effective way possible, and finally build a model that can accurately predict how much a condo/apartment is worth based on its features, such as location, size, number of rooms, number of bedrooms/bathrooms, etc.
